# Description

This is a repository containing frontend code for a semester project. Part of the course of `AI Systems Engineering` in Vilnius Gediminas Technical University.

## Project Background

**AI Spending Insight Assistant with RAG-Grounded Financial Guidance.**

- This project is important because individuals without extensive financial knowledge struggle to reason about their spending habits and categorizing them into habitual and unnecessary ones, leading to inefficient budget management and financial stress. In this context, our AI spending insight assistant offers a practical solution for transforming raw transactional data into clear, user-defined categories, identifying overspending trends, detecting recurring charges and providing grounded recommendations driven by trusted financial-literacy sources.
- Industry relevance is strong: fintech companies, neobanks, and budgeting apps continue to invest heavily in intelligent automation to enhance user engagement and differentiate their offerings. Transaction classification, personalized insights, and transparency features have become core expectations in modern financial applications. However, significant challenges persist, including inconsistent merchant data, opaque fee structures, low financial literacy, and the need for trustworthy explanations rather than opaque model outputs.
- Traditional rule-based systems are rigid and fail to adapt to the nuances of real-world spending. By combining LLM reasoning, RAG-grounded explanations, and lightweight agent workflows, this project directly addresses these issues and represents a realistic, scalable direction for next-generation consumer finance tools.
